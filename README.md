# AWSBobaWebApp
Dynamic website made for online ordering and information about the Boba shop.  It has a Menu, Online Ordering page, About page, Location, and Home page.  See the photos below for the latest updates to the UI.  I use React JS and the semantic ui package for the components.  I use IntelliJ as my IDE as I code and commit to my branches.
